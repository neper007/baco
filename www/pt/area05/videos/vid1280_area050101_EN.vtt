1
00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.880 A:middle
This walk through the Wine Museum

2
00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:03.488 A:middle
ends at the tavern.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.825 A:middle
This priviledge space for the preservation

4
00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:07.310 A:middle
of portuguese tavern's memory

5
00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:10.043 A:middle
is precisely where our visit ends.

6
00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.561 A:middle
In here, the visitor has the opportunity

7
00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:15.133 A:middle
of tasting the wines of Adega Cooperativa.

8
00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:17.309 A:middle
The tavern was planned and constituted 

9
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.229 A:middle
by the engineer Paix?o Magalh?es

10
00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.068 A:middle
its founder, at the museum's origin.

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.904 A:middle
He had this brilliant idea and 

12
00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.491 A:middle
it started as the first tavern built

13
00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:27.189 A:middle
inside a Wine Museum in Portugal.

14
00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.528 A:middle
It follows the model for Ribatejo's taverns

15
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.435 A:middle
since its founder, Paix?o Marques

16
00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:33.720 A:middle
was from Santar?m, in Ribatejo.

17
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.443 A:middle
In it we can see all the elements

18
00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:36.994 A:middle
that were typically present in a tavern

19
00:00:37.214 --> 00:00:40.018 A:middle
specially in the North and South of Portugal

20
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.676 A:middle
which we can see in the posters

21
00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.611 A:middle
of bullfighting, from the South

22
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.413 A:middle
and the religious and traditional festivities

23
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.036 A:middle
usually found in the walls

24
00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:52.099 A:middle
of many taverns in the North.

25
00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.689 A:middle
In our tavern, the visitor can marvel himself

26
00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:57.329 A:middle
with our wines from Adega Cooperativa,

27
00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.945 A:middle
as Montes, for example,

28
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.194 A:middle
very refined and awarded with

29
00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:04.603 A:middle
many nacional and international prizes

30
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.666 A:middle
like the gold medal in the Brussels Wine Fair.

31
00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:11.503 A:middle
This part of the museum is a preserved memory

32
00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:14.510 A:middle
where the public will finish its tour 

33
00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:16.820 A:middle
through the Wine Museum and its history

34
00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:17.976 A:middle
in high spirits.
